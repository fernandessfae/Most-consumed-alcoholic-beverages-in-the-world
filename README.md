# Alcohol drink world analisys

Hello to you who took a moment to understand a little bit about the analysis I'm doing about the alcohol consumption habits of people in each country in the world. Based on a report by Mona Chalabi published on the website fivethirtyeight, where I will leave the [link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) to read more about this subject and [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption) to get data access on GitHub. Well, summarizing a little about the article, she wanted to understand which factors influence the consumption of alcoholic beverages in each country, for this she sought data from the world health organization (WHO) in 2010 to investigate the consumption of these beverages, being divided into 3 groups : beer, wine and spirits, these needing a more detailed explanation, which we will see below, and the results show how many wine glasses, beer cans and spirit shots were consumed per person in each country in 2010.

Spirits is a generic term for any alcoholic beverage distilled from fermented grains, fruits or vegetables. Spirits are different from wine and beer due to the distillation process and the resulting high alcohol content. Distilled alcoholic beverages are, for example, ***whiskey, vodka, gin, tequila, rum and brandy***. In the survey carried out by the reporter, all the spirits mentioned above were considered.

After this explanation, the idea is to show the map with the countries that consume each type of beverage and a chart with the top 10 countries that consume each type of alcoholic beverage. So let's see what was found.

An observation on the maps, the countries marked with black, means that they do not have data on the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
