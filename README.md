# Alcohol drink world analisys

Hello to you who took a moment to understand a little bit about the analysis I'm doing about the alcohol consumption habits of people in each country in the world. Based on a report by Mona Chalabi published on the website fivethirtyeight, where I will leave the [link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) to read more about this subject and [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption) to get data access on GitHub. Well, summarizing a little about the article, she wanted to understand which factors influence the consumption of alcoholic beverages in each country, for this she sought data from the world health organization (WHO) in 2010 to investigate the consumption of these beverages, being divided into 3 groups : beer, wine and spirits, these needing a more detailed explanation, which we will see below, and the results show how many wine glasses, beer cans and spirit shots were consumed per person in each country in 2010.

Spirits is a generic term for any alcoholic beverage distilled from fermented grains, fruits or vegetables. Spirits are different from wine and beer due to the distillation process and the resulting high alcohol content. Distilled alcoholic beverages are, for example, ***whiskey, vodka, gin, tequila, rum and brandy***. In the survey carried out by the reporter, all the spirits mentioned above were considered.

After this explanation, the idea is to show the map with the countries that consume each type of beverage and a chart with the top 10 countries that consume each type of alcoholic beverage. So let's see what was found.

An observation on the maps, the countries marked with black, means that they do not have data on the consumption of alcoholic beverages.

## Beer

Who doesn't like to have a beer, right? If this is not your case, obviously you have someone to take it, whether on the weekends or every happy hour in the company, finally, based on this principle, a map was made to see consumption in the countries of the world, and the graph of the 10 countries that consume the most, seen below.

The first impressions on the map and graph above show that the majority of large beer consumers are found in Europe, with highlights to countries in South-Southwest Africa, and countries such as Venezuela and Australia, located in South America and Oceania, respectively.

## Wine

Wine, considered a drink of high added value, consumed in times of Christ, by the nobility of the Greco-Roman empire, or to celebrate some important moment in our lives, whether it is an anniversary, a wedding party or even enjoying this excellent drink, with its varieties from various locations around the world, and with that we have below the map of wine consumption around the world and the 10 most wine consuming countries.

The first impressions on the map and graph above show that the majority of large wine consumers are in Europe, with highlights to South American countries, and countries such as Equatorial Guinea and Australia, located in Africa and Oceania, respectively.

## Spirit

Spirits are drinks from a select group where the most famous, such as vodka and tequila, for example, are part of this group, so known at Mexican parties or in Eastern European countries such as Russia, or on tourist trips to countries Caribbean, citing the armada's rum, produced in Guyana, among other drinks present in this group.

The first impressions on the map and graph above show that the majority of large wine consumers are distributed in Europe in the Caribbean countries.

## Total alcohol

Now, we will look at a map with the total alcohol consumed by people in each country with the 3 groups of alcoholic beverages, plus the top 10 consumers represented by the *orange*, *pink* and *blue* color markers where these represent *beer*, *wine* and *spirits*, respectively , and followed with a graph of the 10 countries where people drink the most alcohol.

## Conclusion

Some analyzes that can be seen on the map and graph are as follows:

- Most people in Europe consume a huge amount of alcoholic beverages, and these beverages contain a large amount of alcohol in their composition.

- In Central America, people consume a lot of alcohol, because of distilled beverages

- Middle Eastern countries do not consume or consume very little alcoholic beverages

- And a slightly more surprising analysis shows that countries like Nigeria, South Korea and Uganda, despite not being part of the top 10, are countries that contain a lot of alcohol in their drinks, despite people not consuming much.

So folks, the idea here is to use data to generate insight or question some curious facts. Obviously some facts you may already know why, but even so, it is interesting to observe some things.
